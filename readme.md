# FoxBot
Welcome to Foxbot server.
To selfhost:

* Put your Discord Bot Token in `config.json`
* Run `yarn && yarn run production`
Voila.

### Legal stuff:
I do not own the images, and can not verify that none of the images have any copyright. This repo and my docker container found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jonatanholmgren/foxbot) have only **fetches** the images from randomfox.ca, thus making this their responsibility. The GPL 3.0 license included in this repo only applies for **my** code, not the images.
I also take 0 responsibility for this project existing for the long term, as I do not serve the images, and [xinitrc-dev](https://github.com/xinitrc-dev/randomfox.ca) might at any moment bring the site down.
